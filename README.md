# WEB SERVICES FOR CYRELA CASE STUDY

In our application, we focused on providing a standardized documentation using "Swagger" (Open API 3.0) for the Cyrela company.

In this implementation, we provided methods such as "GET" (for pagination), "PUT", "POST", "DELETE" and "GET" (by ID), according to the tables provided by the client, Occurrences and Assistance.

We created a RESTful API in ASP.NET Core 3.1 and implemented automated deployment with Git Actions to Azure services (Microsoft Cloud).

## Notes
The work was done in a team, and all participants can be found in the [official repository](https://github.com/joseBarreto/fiap_cyrela.git).
